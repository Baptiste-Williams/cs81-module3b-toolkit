# Reflection - Math ToolKit

## What patterns or surprises id you notice?
Once I got the hang of it, the functions started to feel kind of the same. I feel like 
they all followed a similar setup. It was cool to see how just changing one line could 
totally change what the function did.

## What logic challenged your thinking?
For me, I feel I had to think a little bit more with testing stuff like even and odd
numbers. It made me slow down a second and really check that the logic worked they way
I thought It would; Im also tired, so that may have something to do with it... 

## How might this kind of toolkit be used in the real world?
I feel that this kind of toolkit could be used in like a calculator app or anything that would 
need to do some math calculations. it felt some what simple, but i could defenitly see 
how it could end up being more difficult.
