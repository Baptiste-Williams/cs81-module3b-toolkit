# CS81 Module 3b - Math Toolkit

This project includes five basic math functions. I wrote this in JavaScript.
I created this for my Module 3b of my CS81 class to help me with practice writing function,
making predictions, testing results all while using github to track my progress.

## Functions that are included on this Toolkit

-'double(n)'
-'square(n)'
-'isEven(n)'
-'isOdd(n)'
-'multiply(a, b)'
